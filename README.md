# Book Search Engine

## Description
This is a website that allows you to search for books that are on the google books api and save a personal list of books. As the purpose of this exercise was to refactor this project from using a restful API to using a graphql/apollo server architecture, I have left some vestigial code in here in the routes folder of the server and several commented out lines of code.

  ## Usage
  This application is a website that is [deployed to render](https://book-search-engine-lw9v.onrender.com/) and requires no extra installation beyond a standard web browser. Users will need to provide an email and username as well as a password, but do not worry as no emails will go to this address from us, it is simply used to identify yourself and log in. Users can go to the site and search for books by name, and after logging in users can save books to their list. Logged in users can also see their list of books and remove books from it by clicking the button on any indidvidual book.

  ## How to Contribute
  Users that seek to contribute can simply fork and use as they please, but be aware you will need to deploy to a site like render or netlify and also create a mongoDB instance. For users interested in providing commits to this repo, there are some features that perhaps deserve to be implemented. A user page that will allow users to change their username, email, or password has yet to be implemented. Different ways for users to categorize or tag their books would be a useful feature, and some implementation that might allow users to at least tag books as "read" or "unread" and filter by those would greatly increase the utility of the site.
